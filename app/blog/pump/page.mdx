# Wi-Fi based pump automation by water %

Manually turning water pumps on and off often leads to overflow, dry running, and water wastage. To solve this, I built a Wi-Fiâ€“based smart pump automation system using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensor, and SSR-40A relay. The system automatically controls the pump based on the water level percentage in the tank and integrates with Home Assistant for remote monitoring and manual control.

## Components Used  

- **ESP8266 NodeMCU** â†’ Wi-Fi microcontroller running ESPHome for automation and communication.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (JSN-SR04T / HC-SR04)** â†’ Measures distance to water surface and converts it into tank water percentage.  
- **SSR-40A Solid-State Relay** â†’ Safely switches the water pump ON/OFF based on ESP8266 signals.  
- **Water Pump** â†’ The load being controlled to fill the tank automatically.  
- **Home Assistant** â†’ Smart home platform for real-time monitoring, alerts, and manual pump control via Wi-Fi.

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle  

- **Water Level Detection** â†’ The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the tank top to the water surface.  
- **Data Processing** â†’ ESP8266 running ESPHome converts this distance into a percentage value.  
- **Pump Control** â†’ Based on set thresholds, ESP8266 triggers the SSR-40A relay to switch the water pump ON or OFF.  
- **Wi-Fi Monitoring** â†’ The data is sent over Wi-Fi to Home Assistant for live tracking.  
- **Manual Override** â†’ Users can control the pump manually through the Home Assistant dashboard if required.

## ðŸ”¹ Features  

- **Automatic Control** â†’ Pump turns ON/OFF based on water % levels.  
- **Prevents Water Wastage** â†’ Stops overflow and avoids dry running.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring** â†’ View tank % and pump status in Home Assistant.  
- **Manual Override** â†’ Control the pump remotely from any device.  
- **Safe Operation** â†’ SSR relay ensures reliable and durable switching.  

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits  

- **Saves Water** â†’ Eliminates overflow and reduces wastage.  
- **Energy Efficient** â†’ Pump operates only when required.  
- **Convenient** â†’ No more manual switching.  
- **Smart Control** â†’ Monitor and operate via Home Assistant app.  
- **Scalable** â†’ Can be extended with sensors like flow meters, TDS, or pressure sensors.
